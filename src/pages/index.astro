        >Currently working at imc learning AG in Germany, though my professional
        roots trace back to the digital plains in Tunisia. Armed with a software
        engineering diploma from a Tunisian University and a cybersec badge from
        an American college, I've journeyed through the binary wilderness to
        fortify digital fortresses against the forces of chaos. Over the course
        of my life and career I have developed expertise in several areas of
        web/mobile development, application security and devsecops. With all
        that said, I don't like to just define myself by the work I've done. My
        inspiration is boundless, it fuels me in the pursuit of cultivating new
        skills. In my downtime, you might find me exploring the pixelated realms
        of retro games, unraveling the intricate plots of anime series, sweating
        it out at the gym, or getting lost in the pages of a captivating book.
        Feel free to review my latest work in my Portfolio and delve deeper into
        my biography, experience, skills, education, and much more in my <a
